As you can see, the game requires at least 6 GB of RAM to run properly. But what if you have a PC with only 4 GB of RAM? Is there a way to play the game without upgrading your hardware? The answer is yes, but you will need to follow some steps and tweaks to make it work. Here are some tips on how to play Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on a PC with 4 GB RAM:

1. Download and install the [4GB RAM FIX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKJ51sEjnTo) from Re:GAMER\_XV's YouTube video[^2^]. This is a patch that modifies some files in the game folder to allow it to run on 4 GB of RAM. Follow the instructions in the video carefully and make sure to backup your original files before applying the patch.
2. Lower your graphics settings in the game options. Go to Options > Graphics and set the Texture Resolution, Shadow Map Resolution, and Particle Quality to Low. You can also disable Depth of Field, Motion Blur, Ambient Occlusion, and Anti-Aliasing for better performance.
3. Close any unnecessary programs and background processes that may be using up your RAM. You can use Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) to check your RAM usage and end any tasks that are not essential for running the game.
4. If you still experience lag or stuttering, you can try using a [low spec configuration file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw9jsuMwIM) from Gamer Brosss' YouTube video[^1^]. This is a file that changes some settings in the game engine to make it run faster on low-end PCs. Follow the instructions in the video carefully and make sure to backup your original file before replacing it.

By following these steps, you should be able to play Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on a PC with 4 GB RAM. However, keep in mind that this is not a guaranteed solution and that your gameplay experience may vary depending on your PC specifications and preferences. If you want to enjoy the game at its full potential, you may want to consider upgrading your hardware or getting a new PC that meets the recommended system requirements for the game.
