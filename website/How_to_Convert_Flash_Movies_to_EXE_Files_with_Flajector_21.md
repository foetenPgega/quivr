Flajector 2.1 has many features that make it a powerful tool for Flash developers and enthusiasts. You can include a Flash player in the generated applications, so they will work even if the user does not have a Flash player installed on their system. You can also create windowless applications that have transparent backgrounds and can interact with the desktop. Flajector 2.1 does not use temporary files, but loads the Flash movies and the Flash player directly from memory, making it faster and more secure.
 
Another advantage of Flajector 2.1 is that it allows you to include all the resources that your Flash movie needs, such as XML, MP3, FLV, SWF, etc., in a single EXE file. This makes it easier to distribute and share your applications without worrying about missing files or compatibility issues. You can also extend your applications with plugins that add extra functionality, such as encryption, compression, splash screens, etc.
 
To use Flajector 2.1, you need to download the ZIP file from one of the many websites that host it, such as [this one](https://coub.com/stories/2302394-flajector-2-1-best-cracked-by-foff-zip). Then, you need to extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer and run the Flajector.exe file. You will see a simple interface where you can select the SWF file that you want to convert, choose the output folder and name for the EXE file, and customize the settings for your application.
 
Some of the settings that you can adjust are:
 
- The icon for your application
- The window size and position
- The window style (normal, borderless, transparent, etc.)
- The Flash player version (from 6 to 9)
- The quality and scale mode of the Flash movie
- The parameters and variables for the Flash movie
- The plugins that you want to use

Once you are done with the settings, you can click on the "Build" button and wait for Flajector 2.1 to create your EXE file. You can then test your application by running it from the output folder or by clicking on the "Run" button in Flajector 2.1.
 
Flajector 2.1 is a useful software for anyone who wants to convert their Flash movies to EXE files and create standalone applications that can run on any Windows system. However, it is important to note that Flajector 2.1 is an illegal version of Flajector that has been cracked by FOFF, and that using it may violate the terms and conditions of Flajector's original developer, Softanics. Therefore, we do not recommend or endorse downloading or using Flajector 2.1 for any purpose.
