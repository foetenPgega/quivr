## What is Palisade @RISK 5.7 and how does it work?
 
Palisade @RISK 5.7 is an add-in tool for Microsoft Excel that helps you make better decisions through risk modeling and analysis. It does this using a technique known as Monte Carlo simulation[^1^].
 
@RISK (pronounced âat riskâ) software integrates seamlessly with Excelâs function set and ribbon, letting you work in a familiar environment with results you can trust[^1^]. You can use @RISK to model any situation that involves uncertainty, such as investment planning, portfolio optimization, cost estimation, engineering reliability, capital reserves, oil, gas, and mineral reserves, and more[^1^] [^2^].
 
@RISKâs Monte Carlo analysis computes and tracks many different possible future scenarios in your risk model, and shows you the probability of each occurring. In this way, @RISK shows you virtually all possible outcomes for any situation. This probabilistic approach makes @RISK a powerful tool that you can use to judge which risks to take and which ones to avoidâcritical insight in todayâs uncertain world[^1^].
