The Inbetweeners Movie is based on the popular British sitcom The Inbetweeners, which aired on E4 from 2008 to 2010. The sitcom follows the lives and struggles of four socially awkward teenage boys who attend a suburban comprehensive school. The show was created by Damon Beesley and Iain Morris, who also wrote and produced the movie. The show was praised for its realistic and hilarious portrayal of teenage life, and won several awards, including a BAFTA and a British Comedy Award.
 
The movie features the same cast as the sitcom, with Simon Bird as Will McKenzie, the uptight and sarcastic narrator; Joe Thomas as Simon Cooper, the lovestruck and loyal friend; James Buckley as Jay Cartwright, the crude and boastful liar; and Blake Harrison as Neil Sutherland, the dim-witted and easy-going dancer. The movie also introduces some new characters, such as Carli D'Amato (Emily Head), Simon's ex-girlfriend and crush; Alison (Laura Haddock), a friendly and attractive girl who catches Will's eye; Lucy (Tamla Kari), a sweet and naive girl who likes Simon; Lisa (Jessica Knappett), a quirky and fun-loving girl who bonds with Neil; and Jane (Lydia Rose Bewley), a shy and insecure girl who falls for Jay. The movie also features some cameo appearances from other actors who appeared in the sitcom, such as Anthony Head as Will's dad, Greg Davies as Mr. Gilbert, the sarcastic head of sixth form, and Belinda Stewart-Wilson as Polly McKenzie, Will's attractive mum.
 
The Inbetweeners Movie was a huge success at the box office, becoming the highest-grossing British comedy film of all time. It also received positive reviews from critics and fans alike, who praised its humour, charm, and nostalgia. The movie was followed by a sequel in 2014, The Inbetweeners 2, which sees the boys reunite for another holiday adventure in Australia. The sequel was also well-received and broke records at the box office. However, both movies were intended as a final farewell to the characters, and there are no plans for a third film or a revival of the sitcom.
