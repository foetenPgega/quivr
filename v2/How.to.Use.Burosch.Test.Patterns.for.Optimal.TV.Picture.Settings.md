Burosch is a German company that specializes in creating test patterns for TV and projector calibration. They offer a variety of test patterns for different purposes, such as checking the aspect ratio, brightness, contrast, color, sharpness, motion and more. You can download their test patterns as PDF files from their website[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] and display them on your TV using a USB stick, a Blu-ray player or a media player.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Burosch test patterns to optimize your TV picture settings in a few simple steps. You will need about 10 minutes of time and a remote control to access your TV menu. By following these instructions, you will be able to unlock the hidden picture potential of your TV and enjoy a much better image quality.
  
## Step 1: Set the Aspect Ratio or Overscan
 
The first thing you need to do is to make sure that your TV is displaying the full image without cropping or stretching it. To do this, you need to use the Burosch Basic Test Pattern No. 1[^1^], which shows four black triangles at the corners of the screen. If you can see all four triangles clearly, then your aspect ratio or overscan setting is correct. If not, you need to adjust it until you can see them.
 
The aspect ratio or overscan setting is usually found in the picture or video menu of your TV. It may have different names depending on your TV model, such as picture size, screen fit, zoom, just scan, dot by dot or pixel perfect. You need to select the option that shows the full image without any cropping or distortion. For example, on some Samsung TVs, you need to select "Screen Fit" instead of "16:9" or "4:3". On some LG TVs, you need to select "Just Scan" instead of "16:9" or "Original". On some Sony TVs, you need to select "Full Pixel" instead of "Normal" or "Wide". Refer to your TV manual for more details.
  
## Step 2: Set the Brightness
 
The next thing you need to do is to set the brightness level of your TV. The brightness setting controls how dark or bright the black areas of the image are. To do this, you need to use the Burosch Basic Test Pattern No. 2[^1^], which shows a gray scale with 16 steps from black to white. You need to adjust the brightness setting until you can see all 16 steps clearly, especially the darkest ones.
 
The brightness setting is usually found in the picture or video menu of your TV. It may have different names depending on your TV model, such as backlight, black level or dark level. You need to increase or decrease the brightness setting until you can see all 16 steps of the gray scale without losing any detail in the shadows or making the image too washed out. Refer to your TV manual for more details.
  
## Step 3: Set the Contrast
 
The third thing you need to do is to set the contrast level of your TV. The contrast setting controls how bright or dim the white areas of the image are. To do this, you need to use the Burosch Basic Test Pattern No. 3[^1^], which shows a gray scale with 16 steps from black to white. You need to adjust the contrast setting until you can see all 16 steps clearly, especially the brightest ones.
 
The contrast setting is usually found in the picture or video menu of your TV. It may have different names depending on your TV model, such as picture mode, white level or light level. You need to increase or decrease the contrast setting until you can see all 16 steps of the gray scale without losing any detail in the highlights or making the image too dull. Refer to your TV manual for more details.
